Foofurple's HTML5 Simple Fundraising Thermometer

A simple HTML5 Canvas / pure javascript app that
lets the user create a fundraising thermometer
image.

The nice thing about this is that it isn't a 
widget or plugin that needs to be installed,
 it just generates a .png image which can 
be used anywhere.

PUBLIC DOMAIN because it's a completely obvious
 thing to do and in a sane world the concept 
of intellectual property would not apply here :)
